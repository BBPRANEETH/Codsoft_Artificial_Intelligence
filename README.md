# Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
 A chatbot with rule-based responses operates on a set of predefined rules or patterns to generate responses based on user input.It has several features andd functionalities that enhance it's performance.These rules are the basis for the types of problems the chatbot is familiar with and can deliver solutions.Here are some key aspects of chatbot with rule based responses:
 
1.Designing Responses: Create a set of rules or patterns that the chatbot will recognize and respond to. These rules could cover common greetings, questions about the internship, and other related topics.

2.Implementation: Use a programming language like Python to implement the chatbot. You can use regular expressions or simple if-else statements to match user input to responses.

3.Testing and Refinement: Test the chatbot with various inputs to ensure it responds correctly according to your rules. Refine the rules based on feedback.

4.Patterns: These are predefined templates or rules that the chatbot uses to recognize user input. For example, a pattern could be "greeting" to handle user greetings like "hello", "hi", or "hey"

5.Pattern Matching: It then uses predefined rules, which can be implemented using techniques like regular expressions or simple if-else conditions, to match the input against patterns.

6.Response Generation: Once a matching pattern is identified, the chatbot selects or generates a response associated with that pattern.

7.Fallback Mechanism: In case the input doesn’t match any predefined patterns, a fallback mechanism can be implemented to handle unexpected inputs, such as a default response like "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.

It's important to note that rule-based chatbots have limitations in handling complex or unpredictable conversations. They rely on predefined rules and may struggle with understanding ambiguous queries or nuanced language. However, they are often suitable for scenarios with well-defined use cases and a limited range of expected user inputs

# Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Developing a TIC-TAC-TOE AI involves creating a program that can play the game intelligently against a human opponent. Here’s a step-by-step outline to approach this task:

1. Game Representation
Board Representation: Decide how to represent the TIC-TAC-TOE board in your programming language. Common choices include using a 3x3 matrix or a flat array of 9 elements.Player Representation: Define constants or variables to represent the players (e.g., X for the human player and O for the AI).

2. Game Logic
Winning Conditions: Implement logic to check for winning conditions after each move (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

3. AI Strategy
Minimax Algorithm: Implement the Minimax algorithm, a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. It helps the AI player to make optimal moves assuming the opponent also plays optimally.Evaluation Function: Define an evaluation function that assigns scores to game states (board positions). This function helps Minimax to determine the best move based on the current state of the board.Depth Limitation: Depending on the complexity of your AI, consider implementing a depth limitation in Minimax to manage computational resources.

4. User Interface: Display: Create a simple interface to display the TIC-TAC-TOE board and accept user input.
Input Handling: Implement logic to handle user moves and update the game board accordingly.

5. Gameplay Loop
Turn Management: Implement a loop to manage turns between the human player and the AI.

6. Testing and Refinement : Test your AI against different scenarios, including winning, losing, and drawing games, to ensure it performs correctly.Refine your AI’s strategy and code based on testing results and performance observations.

7. Alpha-beta Pruning: To optimize the search process, the AI can use alpha-beta pruning, which eliminates the need to explore certain parts of the game tree that are known to be irrelevant. This reduces the number of calculations required to find the best move.

# Example Scenario
1. Initial Setup : The game begins with the empty board.

2. Player move : The human player makes aa move(places X).

3. AI Move : The AI calculates its move using the Minimax algorithm and places O in the optimal square.

4. Game Progression: The game continues with alternating moves until a win, loss, or draw condition is met.
