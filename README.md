# Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
 A chatbot with rule-based responses operates on a set of predefined rules or patterns to generate responses based on user input.It has several features andd functionalities that enhance it's performance.These rules are the basis for the types of problems the chatbot is familiar with and can deliver solutions.Here are some key aspects of chatbot with rule based responses:
 
1.Designing Responses: Create a set of rules or patterns that the chatbot will recognize and respond to. These rules could cover common greetings, questions about the internship, and other related topics.

2.Implementation: Use a programming language like Python to implement the chatbot. You can use regular expressions or simple if-else statements to match user input to responses.

3.Testing and Refinement: Test the chatbot with various inputs to ensure it responds correctly according to your rules. Refine the rules based on feedback.

4.Patterns: These are predefined templates or rules that the chatbot uses to recognize user input. For example, a pattern could be "greeting" to handle user greetings like "hello", "hi", or "hey"

5.Pattern Matching: It then uses predefined rules, which can be implemented using techniques like regular expressions or simple if-else conditions, to match the input against patterns.

6.Response Generation: Once a matching pattern is identified, the chatbot selects or generates a response associated with that pattern.

7.Fallback Mechanism: In case the input doesnâ€™t match any predefined patterns, a fallback mechanism can be implemented to handle unexpected inputs, such as a default response like "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.
It's important to note that rule-based chatbots have limitations in handling complex or unpredictable conversations. They rely on predefined rules and may struggle with understanding ambiguous queries or nuanced language. However, they are often suitable for scenarios with well-defined use cases and a limited range of expected user inputs
