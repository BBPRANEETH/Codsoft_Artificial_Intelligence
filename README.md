# Codsoft Internship - Artificial Intelligence 
# Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
1.Designing Responses: Create a set of rules or patterns that the chatbot will recognize and respond to. These rules could cover common greetings, questions about the internship, and other related topics.

2.Implementation: Use a programming language like Python to implement the chatbot. You can use regular expressions or simple if-else statements to match user input to responses.

3.Testing and Refinement: Test the chatbot with various inputs to ensure it responds correctly according to your rules. Refine the rules based on feedback.
